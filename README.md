VeraAutomation
==========

This is a basic iOS app for controlling a Vera automation system. It was designed around my personal VeraLite setup and not all parts will work for everyone. The Audio control part only works with a custom Vera plugin that I wrote to talk to my Russound audio units over TCP/IP. I have also added code to ignore certain devices that I don't want shown; this is particular to my setup and likely shouldn't be left in if used anywhere else.

This is a work in progress. The iPhone part is nearing completion; the iPad part hasn't been started.

You must make it clear in your documentation that you are responsible for any application you develop.

If you would like to use the code in a commercial project, please contact me at <licensing@grubysolutions.com>. My terms are pretty reasonable in that I require a copy of whatever your develop (including hardware, if you plan on using it with a piece of hardware other than the VeraLite that I own and you are a hardware manufacturer) and must comply with the terms above.

You may not bundle the application as is (or remove pieces and bundle it) and distribute it.

This license is pretty simple and if you have any questions, please contact me.
