The source code or any portion of it may be used in any application used for non-commercial purposes without payment. However, you must attribute the work to me with something like:

Portions Â©2013 Scott Gruby. All rights reserved.

You must make it clear in your documentation that you are responsible for any application you develop.

If you would like to use the code in a commercial project, please contact me at <licensing@grubysolutions.com>. My terms are pretty reasonable in that I require a copy of whatever your develop (including hardware, if you plan on using it with a piece of hardware other than the VeraLite that I own and you are a hardware manufacturer) and must comply with the terms above.

You may not bundle the application as is (or remove pieces and bundle it) and distribute it.

This license is pretty simple and if you have any questions, please contact me.
